== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a rating form into my post =

There are three ways to place a rating form into a post:

* Setting display position of rating form in plugin settings to before_content or after_content
* Inserting the '[displayRatingForm]' shorcode into your post. You can use a different post ID by adding parameter post_id i.e. ‘[displayRatingForm post_id="10" title="My rating form"]’ for post ID 10. If you do not set a post_id, the current post ID from the WP loop is used.
* Modifying theme code to call API function 'display_rating_form()'. This function must be called with the loop or the post ID must be provided as a parameter i.e. ‘echo display_rating_form(array('post_id' => "10", 'title' => 'My rating form')’ for post ID 10. If you do not set a post_id, the current post ID from the WP loop is used.

= How do I add a rating results into my post =

There are three ways to place the rating results into a post:

* Setting display position of rating results in plugin settings to before_title or after_title
* Inserting the '[displayRatingResult]' shorcode into your post. You can use a different post ID by adding parameter post_id i.e. ‘[displayRatingResult post_id="10"]’ for post ID 10
* Modifying theme code to call API function 'display_rating_result()'. This function must be called with the loop or the post ID must be provided as a parameter i.e. ‘echo display_rating_result(array('post_id' => '10'))’ for post ID 10.

= How do I display the top rating results? =

There are three ways to display the top rating results:

* Add the top rating results widget to a widget area in your theme
* Insert the '[displayRatingTopResults]' shortcode into your post. By default, the top 10 rating results are returned but you can customise this by passing in a parameter for the count i.e. ‘[displayRatingTopResults count="10" title="My top rating results"]’
* Modifying theme code to call API function echo ‘display_rating_top_results()’. By default, the top 10 rating results are returned but you can customise this by passing in a parameter for the count i.e. ‘echo display_rating_top_results(array('count' => '20', 'title => 'My top rating results'))’ for 20 top rating results. 

= How is the rating calculated? =

Each rating item currently carries an equal weight. Each rating item is given a rating out of 5 and then the average is calculated to produce the overall rating result.

= What happens if I delete a rating item even though visitors have submitted a rating previously with this rating item? =

All prior rating entry results will include the deleted rating item in their rating result. The rating item is not included in any new rating entry results.

= How can I change the style of the rating form or rating results? =

You can change the style by adding CSS in your theme. There is a custom CSS option in the plugin settings page.

= Can I prevent visitors from submitting the same rating forms multiple times for the same post? =

Yes, there is an option to prevent visitors this in the plugin settings page. Check the rating form IP address date time validation option. This will prevent a visitor from submitting a rating form multiple times within a 24 hour period. The visitors IP address is used to identify them.

= Are the rating form and rating results responsive? =

Yes they are OK in a responsive web design except the star rating image is 130px fixed width. The rating results text wrap onto the next line and the rating form is a HTML table.

= What is the algorithm for weighted rating? =

Each multi rating is adjusted based on the weight.

Let V = value of multi-rating

M = max rating value for multi-rating item

W = weight for multi-rating item

C = count or multi-rating items

TW = total weights of multi-rating items

First we figure out the adjustment percentage we need to make based on the current multi-rating weight and the total multi-rating weights

A = adjustment percentage = (W / TW) * C

i.e. a count of 3 and a total weight of 4 (2, 1 and 1 for each multi-rating item)

this will create the following adjustment:

(2 / 4) * 3 = 1.5

(1 / 4) * 3 = 0.75

So if we add up the adjustments it equals the the count 1.5 + 0.75 + 0.75 = 3. If all the weights are the same, it will still equal the count.

This adjustment is then multiplied to the overall rating result = (V / M) * A

= How do I remove the title from the rating form and top rating results? =

Set an empty title for the shortcode or set an empty default title in the plugin settings. E.g. ‘[displayRatingForm post_id="1" title=""]’ and ‘[displayRatingTopResults count="10" title=""]’. If the title is not present in the shortcode, the default will be used (e.g. ‘[displayRatingForm post_id="1"]’).
